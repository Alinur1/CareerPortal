This project is made with ASP.NET MVC, Angular JS and MS SQL server(Used Entity Framework). By using this project, Employer can post a job and the applicants can apply for the job. On the other hand, there is an admin section from where admin can manage everything.

[N.B: This project is still under development, but you can run the project without any hesitations. Just enable, add migration and update the database. That's it. Some of the admin features are still missing which will be updated soon.]
